Hey big thanks for your purchase!
My suggestions:
I suggest you use this animations and playing 
creating your own blend-tree animations.
In addition you can find online some other animations's clip files
or package if you want.
About the texture , I suggest you "less is more".
I meant you can use a simple Diffuse/bumped shader-material.
But this zombie goes well with some retro-psx style.
Take a gaze to the lighting to avoid dull model.
Enjoy!.
